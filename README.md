Expansive Java Gaming Library for JDK 1.8 or Above

UnitedUnion Engine Documentation
Version: 1.0 
Release: Pre-Alpha
Next Release: Pre-Alpha V10.0 Final

INTRODUCTION
Motivation:
UnitedUnion is a lightweight engine that abstract away much of the rigors of creating a game by hand. With the simple library, basic games are easily created. Much of the reasons behind the inception of this engine is to engender a sense of fulfillment in people who would otherwise never create game due to the time requirements. As such, this engine is created more as an educational tool than the power source for the next blockbuster gaming hit. It is casual.
UnitedUnion is fluid. It is built to be easily customizable, and users should be able to include extensions at their own convenience to further expand the capabilities available. 

Engine Goal:
Ultimately, UnitedUnion should become open source for all to contribute to once the ground works are laid out. The engine will address a diverse array of languages including C++, Java, Android, and etc, enabling a synergistic environment of programming.
